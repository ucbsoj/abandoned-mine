          <p><span class ="firstcharacter">M</span>ines have once made the wealth of their towns, their people, their companies, and the state of Colorado. But this wealth came with a price — an environmental price tag. </p>

          <p>Today, Colorado counts more than 23,000 abandoned mines and 12 former mining sites on the Environmental Protection Agency’s radar through the Superfund program’s National Priority List. This list indexes the most toxic sites that need immediate attention and action.</p>
          
          <p>Silverton, Creede and Aspen have similar stories, all are former mining towns with engaged citizens, but different outcomes. </p>

          <p>While Silverton made the headlines in 2015 when its nearby river turned orange putting the spotlight on the perpetual discharge of heavy metals coming from mining sites and creating a large Superfund site of 48 mines, Creede is planning to plug its leaking tunnel while hoping for mining to come back. As for Aspen, it is one of the very few sites in Colorado that have been delisted from the National Priority List after a 10-year-long battle led by the local residents. </p>

          <p><span class ="firstcharacter">S</span>cott Roberts was in his office in Durango located about two blocks from the Animas River. The day started like any others until the phone rang. “Hey, there’s been a mine release in the Silverton area and it’s heading down to Durango.” It was August 5, 2015.</p> 

           <p> Durango is located about 50 miles downstream from Silverton where a contractor hired by the Environmental Protection Agency was doing that morning some investigation work at the Gold King Mine, which caused the leak of the pressurized water behind the collapse portal of the mine and the discharge of 3 million gallons of contaminated water into the Animas River. </p>

           <p> As Roberts was wrapping his head around what just happened. Pictures of the river turning orange began to pop up. “It was coming our way,” said Roberts, who works as an aquatic ecologist for the Mountain Studies Institute, a not-for-profit mountain research and education center. </p>

           <p> Roberts and his colleagues grabbed sampling and filtering equipment, bottles and nets the next day. They went down to the river and started collecting water samples and waiting. </p>

            <p>But nothing happened until August 6 at 10 pm, about 36 hours after the incident.</p>

            <p>Roberts even started to think that maybe the mine release wouldn’t reach Durango. </p>

           <p> The sun had gone down for a while now. Roberts and his colleagues were standing on bridges with flashlights pointing at the river when suddenly around 10 pm, the water finally started changing color. </p>

           <p>The scene was surreal for the scientists but also and for the locals who woke up in the morning with their nearby river now orange.</p>

            <p>The spill put the spotlight on a massive issue that most of the US western states are facing: the discharge and difficult cleanup of abandoned mines. 
            </p>
        
           <p>The Gold King Mine was shut down in 1922. It is one of the 400 abandoned and inactive mine sites located in the Upper Animas Watershed. </p>
        <p>The latest operating mine closed in 1991, but these sites still discharge contaminated water that contains heavy metals such as cadmium, zinc, iron, arsenic, copper, manganese, lead, and aluminum into streams, which made the watershed unable to sustain aquatic life.</p>

            <p>Though the sight was alarming, the Gold King Mine spill did not cause any fish kills.</p> 

            <p>Roberts reported enormous spikes in metals during the spill. “Some of the metals were 100 to 1,000 times greater than they were before the event,” he said. </p>

            <p>But it didn’t last. “It was like a slug of mine water that moved through in just a couple of days,” Roberts said. If it had stayed at those elevated metal concentrations for longer, Roberts thinks, there would have been a much greater impact on aquatic life. The sludge moved quickly so aquatic life wasn’t exposed to high levels of contaminants for more than a few days.

      <p> After the spill, federal and state officials came into town to talk about the issue. The Town of Silverton, San Juan County, City of Durango, La Plata County, local tribes and other interested stakeholders wrote a letter to request that the site be added to the National Priority List of the Superfund program. </p>

      <p>The Superfund program designed toxic sites that need to be cleaned up. It is under the EPA’s jurisdiction. The National Priority List (NPL)  is part of the program and gathers the sites that need to be treated first due to their toxicity. </p>
 
      <p>In September 2016, the EPA finally added the Bonita Peak Mining District, which includes the Gold King Mine and 47 other abandoned sites, to the NPL. </p>

      <p>The EPA pushed multiple times before for the creation of a Superfund site, but the community had always been reticent about declaring the mine as a Superfund site until the Gold King Mine spill happened, because some of them had the hope to potentially start mining again in the area and any site designated as a Superfund would have had drastic effects of ever seeing it open and providing economic opportunities for the community.</p>

      <p>“When your economy relies on visitors coming, you're worried of course that the people will not come visit because they think it's an unhealthy place,” Ty Churchwell of Trout Unlimited said. “Well, the Gold King Spill opened the door. The whole world saw it.”</p>

      <p>The spill happened six years ago, but the issue hasn’t been resolved despite EPA taking over the site and the cleanups, essentially due to the complexity and the size of the Superfund site.

      <p>Despite the drastic effects of the Gold King Spill, the EPA announced last January that they plan this summer to drill into a different mine, the collapsed entrance of the Bandora Mine near Silverton that’s also at risk of a blowout. </p>

      <p>“If the situation sounds familiar, it is,” wrote The Durango Herald on Jan. 16. According to the Durango Herald, the collapsed portal could create a blowout that could put numbers of people at risk, but no one knows how much water is behind the entrance. According to The Durango Herald, the EPA intends to remove a pile of dirt and rock blocking the entrance.</p>
 
      <p>According to the Bureau of Land Management, there are about half a million abandoned mines across the country — and most are in the West. More than 23,000 of them are in Colorado.</p>

        <p>Most mine owners left without cleaning up their properties except the latest mine operator, Sunnyside Gold Corp, which signed a consent decree in 1996. Sunnyside agreed to bulkhead its mine, which consists of placing a plug in the mine, and to clean up abandoned mines nearby. Sunnyside operated a water treatment plan that Kinross Gold Corporation took over in 2003, but the plant stopped operating after technical and financial troubles the next year.</p>
 
        <p>“When Sunnyside Gold was treating the water before the consent decree, the water quality here was much better for the macroinvertebrates. The benthic insects were a lot healthier in the river and so the water. The trout population was better. But when they stopped treating it, we got back to the high iron and aluminum, which are hard for the fish,” John Ott, the general manager of Animas Water Company, said.</p>

        <p>Durango’s drinking water is groundwater and comes from the Florida River. In the early 20th century, Durango was using the Animas River as its water supply, but because the mines were dumping mining waste in the river, Durango switched to the Florida River where no one was mining or dumping anything in the river. Now the Animas River in Durango meets quality standards and is used only as a backup water supply.
         </p>
        <p>After the spill in 2015, Ott had to make sure drinking water was safe in Durango. “I worked closely with the state engineer’s office and the water quality control division to test our water and test other wells, drinking water wells, in the valley to make sure there wasn't going to be any effect from the spill,” Ott said. “And there wasn't.”</p>

         <p>Abandoned mines are a serious threat to the environment, especially to water quality, and to insect and fish populations. In most former mining districts, the watersheds have not seen any fish in decades. </p>

         <p>But as we get farther away from the mines, water quality gets better. In Durango, for example, fish can be found in the Animas River because the town is 50 miles away downstream from the mines, and so dilution has made the streams less concentrated in heavy metals than they are in Silverton, which is closer to the mines.
         </p>
         <p>Several studies over the years have shown that ptarmigans in the Animas River watershed have a lower life span. Those little birds that look like chickens have been impacted by elevated levels of cadmium, which makes their bones brittle and die easily. Other species, like the American robin may be at risk from lead exposure.</p>
         
         <br>

         <h3>Liability and action</h3>
         <br>


         <p>Peter Butler was running the Animas River Stakeholders group as the coordinator until 2019 when the group ceased to exist.</p>

         <p>Butler has been involved with mine reclamation issues since 1994, when Colorado Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) started to look at the problems around Silverton and realized how complex the situation was. </p>

         <p>“The stakeholders’ group was really one of the first watershed groups in the state of Colorado, but it was different than a lot of watershed groups in Colorado,” Butler said. “The animal stakeholders’ group was actually formed because of the fear of what will happen if somebody will impose something from the outside.”</p>

         <p>The group partnered with state and federal agencies and collected data for several years. The Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety sampled about 160 draining mines and about 140 waste piles. They measured how much metals were coming from the different sites to identify the top priority sites. The stakeholders’ group, then, estimated how much work could be done. About 60 remediation projects were done by the stakeholders’ group and its partners.</p>

         <p>But the Clean Water Act of 1972 makes third-party groups liable if they touch an abandoned site to clean it up.</p>

         <p>“It basically got to the point where the stakeholders’ group was kind of stuck,” Butler said. “We had done pretty much all the mine waste projects we had wanted to do or felt we could do, and we couldn't address the draining mines because of liability issues and financial issues.”</p>

         <p>The group was able to do some capping and cleanup mine waste projects, which generally requires little maintenance. But they couldn’t touch on the acid draining mines, which release contaminated water into streams.</p>

         <p>Once the mine sites became part of the Superfund program, which follows the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and transferred the jurisdiction of the cleanup to the EPA.</p>

         <p>In 2019, the stakeholders’ group was shut down after being around for 25 years. Butler said the EPA wasn’t paying much attention to them, so they decided to create a Community Advisory Group (CAG), which under CERCLA forces the EPA to interact with them, even though they don’t have to listen to them. </p>

         <h3>Treating the water</h3>
  <br>
         <p>A 15-minute drive from Silverton, following the turns of Cement Creek, to the ghost town of Gladstone, a gray sheet metal building sits surrounded by gray and off-white silos. “That’s the water treatment plant,” Churchwell said. </p>

              <p>“Right now, we have to rely on a lime treatment plant, but the reality is that's only treating one mine — and there are 48 mining or mining-related sites in this district,” Michelle Furi, the Mountain Studies Institute’s deputy director said. “It's really not tackling the problem, it’s barely even touching it.”</p>

              <p>MSI encourages innovation in mine cleanups.</p>

              <p>“Unfortunately, what we have right now is that sort of dinosaur of a lime treatment plant,” Furi said.</p>

              <p>Treatment plants are costly because they require at least $1 million a year to run without any end in sight. The limestone needs to be mined elsewhere — for the Gladstone treatment plant, lime is mined in Monarch pass, about 165 miles away.</p>

              <p>“They [treatment plants] create this cumbersome byproduct of the sludge that then has to be dried out, then it has to be trucked and stored permanently somewhere else, and then capped,” Furi said. “The carbon footprint there is just astronomical.”</p>

              <p>The two most common “solutions” to clean up mine sites are water treatment plans and bulkheads. The problem with bulkheads is that they usually regulate the flow, but they don’t stop the contamination from happening. Bulkheads help to change the chemistry of the water, as acidity occurs when oxygen is present. So as the tunnel fills up with water behind a bulkhead, oxygen disappears, which makes the water cleaner.</p>

              <p>Before the spill in 2015, the EPA installed a bulkhead at Red & Bonita the same year, but they didn’t close the valve until summer 2020. Then, they reopened the valve in September 2020 to drain down the impounded water behind the bulkhead. That water then goes to the Gladstone water treatment plant to be treated.</p>

              <p>The experiment helps better understand the hydrology of the region.</p>

              <p>MSI holds an annual innovation expo and a boot camp, which acts as an accelerator for startups. “There's a lot of technologies that are innovative from drones and robotics to bio cement,” Furi said.</p>

              <p>But innovation has to overcome the lack of money and comply with a complex regulation framework.</p>

              <p>“We see EPA really wanting to engage with that and looking for innovative technologies to incorporate them where they can in these sites,” Furi said. “We have a long way to go.”</p>

              <p>Wetlands could be one of the possible solutions. In 2019, contractors for the Bureau of Land Management were finishing a constructed wetlands with an iron terrace at Elk Tunnel, which can act as natural filters to neutralize the acidity.</p>

              <p>Electrocoagulation, which consists of injecting electricity into the water to remove heavy metals has also been attempted at the American Tunnel in 2012.</p>

              <p>“One of the challenges, there, is the volume,” Furi said. Most innovative technologies were tested on small volumes of water, and often cannot handle the volume that a water treatment plant can.</p>

              <p>But if most innovative solutions haven’t been implemented at a larger scale, it’s also because each site has different geology, terrain, conditions that make it difficult to replicate an idea from one site to another.</p>

              <p>“There's the politics behind it,” Furi said. “It's risk management, assessing what is the risk for testing and putting that capital behind these and changing regulation.”</p>

              <p>EPA allocates about $1 billion to Superfund each year. In 2019, about $849,000 were spent on cleanups.</p>

              <p>“They spent some money diverting drainage around, buying waste piles, but it’s unclear whether that’s made any difference whatsoever,” Butler said. “They have spent a lot of money doing studies there, whether or not those studies are really going to get them to a solution is a little unclear.”</p>

              <p>Having such a large mining district that includes 48 mines makes cleanup projects go slower, as some smaller sites could have taken a few thousand dollars to be cleaned up.</p>

              <p>Superfund sites also require finding responsible parties to pay for cleanups. “The unfortunate thing about all this is there's a lot of money being spent in the legal end of things,” Terry Morris, a former engineer at Sunnyside Gold and a CAG member said. “In the 90s when I was here, the Animas Stakeholders group was little by little taking care of things that the local population deemed helpful, and then with the Superfund, it became a bureaucracy.”</p>

              <p>The 2015 spill wasn’t the first incident. In 1978, the high alpine lake, Lake Emma, located about 12,000 feet high, crashed through the Sunnyside Mine where Morris was working. It blasted out the mine portal and turned the river black all the way down into New Mexico. It did kill all the fish, shut down the mine for at least two years.</p>

              <p>Since then, a lot of cleanups have happened, especially starting in the 1990s. Yet, the largest acid draining mines still need to be cleaned up.</p>

              <p>“There's still some things to learn we don't fully understand, the mine pool underneath the Superfund site and how all the mines are connected and all springs are connected across the different watersheds in the Upper Animas for example,” Roberts said. “We don't know exactly how the fractures and mine tunnels interact,” he said. “The geology is complex, so there's lots of fractures that intersect mine tunnels.”</p>

              <p>Roberts is now researching how these cleanup efforts may need to adjust to climate change.</p>

              <p>“Especially with increasing frequency of drought, a lot of these river levels are lower and that may mean that mine drainage may be a larger contribution to the surface water and thus metal concentrations are higher,” Roberts said. “Or it may mean that less water from snowmelt makes it into the mines and there may be less mind drainage in the future.”</p>

              <p>Either way, it definitely has implications for water treatment moving forward, he said, and how the success of remediation should be measured.</p>

     <p> But the mining past isn’t only reflected in the economy of the town of Creede, which counts 300-400 residents, but also in the water. Willow Creek, which flows across town, is highly contaminated with heavy metals from the abandoned mines located on the northern side of the town. </p>

     <p>The Nelson Tunnel is responsible for most of the contamination as 365 gallons per minute on average flood out of the tunnel and into the creek. The tunnel was built to drain the water out of the underground workings of various nearby mines. About 48-50% of the contaminated water comes from the Nelson Tunnel and another mine, the Solomon Mine. The contamination makes the creek unable to support fish and benthic invertebrates bugs. </p>

     <p>“The Nelson isn't the only problem, it's just the biggest,” Heather Greenwolf, the executive director of Headwaters Alliance, said. Headwaters Alliance is a nonprofit organization that works toward improving the watershed in Creede.</p>

     <p>Since 2008, the tunnel and the Commodore Waste Rock Pile have been designated as a Superfund site. </p>

     <p>Last fall, the EPA proposed an $11 million plan that would install bulkheads inside the Nelson tunnel to regulate the contaminated water flow and prevent the sudden release of 20 million gallons of impounded water. </p>

            <p>Before mining, the Ute tribe inhabited the area. Then, in the mid and late 19th century, settlers and tourists came to fish and enjoy the hot springs and the Ute were forced out of the Creede area. Then, in the 1890s, the town boomed with silver mining. </p>

In the upper watershed of East Willow Creek, above the Solomon mine, there are good fishing populations and higher levels of benthic  invertebrates.

        <p>“We just did benthic sampling on five sites in the whole watershed,” Greenwolf said. “Everything above the Nelson and everything above the Solomon was within normal limits.” </p>

</p>
         <p>“There's a whole trophic effect that happens,” Greenwolf said. The lack of fish leads to a lack of birds. The resulting absence of vegetation, especially lower in the floodplain, is also a barrier to habitat.

            <h3>Expensive repairs for a small town</h3><br>

<p>Another issue regarding the legacy of mining is the impact on the town’s sewage system, which has reported high levels of heavy metals at the water treatment plant. </p>

<p>A 2019 commissioned study by the town explains that Willow Creek, which contains heavy metals, like zinc and cadmium, may have contaminated the groundwater. The groundwater then infiltrates the cracked sewer pipes, which then reaches the water treatment plant. The levels of metal in the sewage system at Creede’s water treatment plant exceeds the state’s limitations. CDPHE has approached the town and issued notices of violations. They asked the town to repair the pipes to meet water standards. </p>

              <p>
                Creede has been trying to solve this issue for several years. The town is planning to start to repair the pipes next summer, but the price tag is high. </p>

              <p>The town has asked the EPA for help, Barry Steinberg, the town’s lawyer, said. But “the EPA’s focus is on stopping another catastrophic event, but that doesn't stop the acid mine drainage from continuing to seep and run down to us,” Steinberg said.</p>

              <p>To repair the pipes, it would cost XXXX to the town, which is seeking financial assistance and has asked Colorado’s Department of Local Affairs for grants. But Louis Fineberg, the town’s manager, thinks the DLA’s money won’t be enough. </p>

              <p>“Creede is a small place, and the people here are not wealthy, and they're being asked to do a very large project that really was not (theirs),” Fineberg said. “Creede is very dependent on its summer tourists, and a big part of that revolves around water quality because people are out there fishing, and if that goes away then Creede is really in trouble.”</p>

              <p>From 2017 to 2020, the EPA and Pioneer, which conducted mining operations in Creede from 1983 to 1989, engaged in extensive litigation to cover the cost of the cleanups. In September 2020, Pioneer finally signed a consent decree with the EPA that will make Pioneer pay nearly $5.8 million to the EPA for the cleanup at the Superfund site. </p>

            <br>

              <p>While driving up in the mountains, along the Bachelor Loop, the main tourist attraction of Creede, the former towns of Bachelor and Weaver have now disappeared. Most structures that were built in spruce rotted and nowadays only large open fields are left. </p>

              <p>Most towns were built very close to the mines because access was difficult. With the construction of the Nelson Tunnel, it made access easier for the miners who worked at the Amethyst mine. They were now able to live downtown and use the tunnel to access their workplace. </p>
              <p>Only the ore houses near the Nelson Tunnel are still visible. But the structures are becoming brittle. </p>

              <p>
                Recently, Mineral County has been working with the EPA to become the landowners of the Superfund site, which will include the ore houses. </p>

              <p>The county’s administrator, Janelle Kukuk, said the properties will be donated to Mineral County so they can rehabilitate the structures and keep that mining heritage intact. Mineral County will become the owners of the Nelson Tunnel and Commodore Level 5, which currently are privately owned. The goal for EPA is to eliminate the current land owner’s liability, but it wouldn’t transfer the liability to the county. </p>

              <p>“It's important for us to maintain that iconic set of structures and make it something that does go into perpetuity,” Kukuk said. “One of the buildings, if it stays standing for another 18 months, we're going to be really really lucky. We’re hoping we can get in there before it truly does fall off the side of the mountain.”</p>

              <p>Kukuk came to Creede in 1984 to work at Homestake Mine as an accounts payable clerk. She worked for about eight months before the mine closed down. It took a decade, she said, before Creede could transition to a tourist town. </p>

                The project used to be Homestead Mine Co., which mined the Bulldog Mine, and shut down in 1985. About ten years ago, Hecla came and bought the entire district through Rio Grande Silver. </p>

              <p>  McClure explained that they’re now looking to reopen the mine as silver prices go up. They’re tackling several issues to avoid being sued and liable for water treatment in perpetuity.  </p>

              <p>  “We have a reclamation plan in place,” McClure said. They intend to put the disturbance to the ground, cover it with topsoil and seeded with natural vegetation.</p>

              <p>  McClure said that the tunnels for the Bulldog Mine don’t have water coming out, unlike the Nelson Tunnel. </p>

              <p> “Having a Superfund site next door definitely heightens everybody's awareness of what's going on,” McClure said. “The EPA in late 2019-2020 has changed and become more willing to work with us.”</p>

              <p>  When Homestead was operating, there was no water coming out of the Nelson Tunnel because they treated the water through their own treatment plant. But once they closed, water started to trickle out of the Nelson Tunnel again. </p>

              <p>  There is hope now that by reopening the Bulldog mine, it would solve the problem with the Nelson Tunnel.</p>

              <p>  “We keep hoping that maybe Hecla would get something going,” said Wyley, former miner and the Mines & Memories store owner. “That would bring prosperity to town, school systems would fill up with kids, businesses would grow, people would have jobs — although there's not that many miners left in Creede.”</p>

              <p>  But nothing is never 100% guaranteed with water as it infiltrates through the smallest cracks. Mining tunnels have linked the different mines altogether, making the cleanup of the Nelson Tunnel complex.</p>

              <p>  “They had tunnels going everywhere, it’s just like ants digging a damn anthill,” Wyley said. </p>

          <p> <span class ="firstcharacter">T</span>he site is one of the few in the state of Colorado that was delisted from the National Priority List of the Superfund Program. 

</p>

          <p>If the site was listed in the first place, it was due to the presence of high levels of lead and cadmium in the soil — which can be dangerous for young children and pregnant women.</p>

          <p>In 1988, Clapper was a nurse, a mother of a 3-year-old son and pregnant with her second child. She had just moved to the trailer park, which was built on top of a tailing pond, which stores mining waste, made of lead from silver mining.</p>
          
          
           <p>About 1,000 people live in Clapper’s neighborhood— and most are local workers. The site got listed on the National Priority List in 1986, but it’ was not until 1988-1989 that the EPA started to come into town and proposed a cleanup plan, which meant for locals bulldozers coming into their neighborhood.</p>
          
          
           <p>In 1988, Clapper was a nurse, a mother of a 3-year-old son and pregnant with her second child. She had just moved to the trailer park, which was built on top of a tailing pond, which stores mining waste, made of lead from silver mining</p>
          
          
           <p>Clapper, who is now working as a county commissioner, was one of the most vocal residents against the listing, as she feared that the cleanup of the neighborhood would bring more dangers to the health of her children than necessary.</p>
          
          
           <p>The listing occurred after a graduate student from Colorado State University started to research the presence of lead and cadmium in the soil in Aspen Smuggler in 1981. He found elevated levels of heavy metals in the garden vegetables and flowers, up to 20,000 parts per million for lead, about twenty times more than the acceptable levels of lead defined by the EPA in Colorado. The student started to informed the residents, the city and the county about his findings. The following year, the EPA started to investigate the extent of the contamination, until the EPA became fully involved at the site in 1983, at the request of the county.

</p>
          <p>“There was a misconception on the part of many,” said Tom Dunlop, the Superfund site manager working for Pitkin County. At the time, Dunlop worked as the county’s environmental health director. The intent of the Superfund program, which was brand new at the time, was misinterpreted. </p>

          <p>The county thought it was money the government would give them to clean up a site. In the 1980s, the area around the trailer park was littered with debris left over from the mining era. But after the county sent a letter to the EPA inviting them to Aspen, the EPA project manager came into town and met Dunlop. </p>

   <p>“He had a pad of paper with a whole schedule of events that EPA was going to do over the next two years, and after talking to him for a couple of hours I realized that this was way bigger than anything the county commissioners had ever thought about when they wrote that letter,” Dunlop said. “There wasn't free money, but it was payback money.”

          <p>When Clapper started to learn more about the presence of the EPA in her neighborhood, she came across studies about sites with higher levels of lead and real risks of exposure. So she started to wonder why her home was actually part of a Superfund site.</p>

          <p>“They needed a feather in their cap in order to show that they've been able to do something,” Clapper said. “What better place, with the media attention, the notoriety of Aspen, Colorado, the fact it was lead in young children, they were saving us!”</p>

          <p>In 1988, the EPA announced to the residents of the Superfund site, which covers about 110 acres, they could become liable for part of the cost of the cleanup. The EPA wanted to dig down contaminated soil to clean it up, but by digging it, Clapper said, lead could become airborne and absorbed through the lungs, which could have created greater risks.</p>

          <p>“They were not going to move us out of our neighborhood, we're going to have bulldozers,” Clapper said.</p>

          <p>Clapper told the EPA she was also concerned about dust getting into her home. The EPA said they would seal them. </p>

          <p>“That's putting us in a tomb for the summer, we can't live in a trailer that is sealed with plastic wrap,” Clapper told the EPA.</p>

          <p>The EPA also didn't conduct any blood tests on the residents until 1990. </p>

          <p>“My daughter was the first one, she was a year and a half old. She was the first one stuck with a needle,” Clapper said. “I said (to the EPA) I want to know if my daughter's at risk., Aand if my daughter's at risk, this place will be cleaned up in a heartbeat, if my daughter's not at risk, you're out of here.”</p>

          <p>When  the results came in, her daughter was not at risk like the other children who tested less than ten micrograms. The Centers of Disease Control defineds toxic lead level as anything above 10 micrograms per deciliter at the time (the CDC updated its recommendation to 5 micrograms per deciliter in 2012).</p>

          <p>Clapper kept fighting until the EPA decided to delist the site.</p>

          <p>After 10 years of battle for Clapper, who became a county commissioner, the institutional controls document was signed and the site was delisted the site.</p>

          <p>But there are conditions attached, such as a five-year review from the EPA, the notice letter sent every year to the Smuggler residents, and a letter sent every six months to the EPA and the state of Colorado’s health department that addresses a list of questions and declares any violations or anomalies.</p>

          <p>“If we don't do that, the consent decree allows for the EPA to take more of an active role in Smuggler again because we would have failed in our obligation to the consent decree,” Dunlop said. “It's not going to go away.”</p>

          <p>The EPA jurisdiction for day-to-day activities was transferred to the county and the city, who still need to report to the EPA any changes. </p>

          <p>Residents need to fill out a permit before doing any excavation work, as soon as they move more than one cubic yard of soil. The soil then goes to the county’s landfill. Typically, between two to 10 permits are submitted to the city a year, CJ Oliver, Aspen’s environmental health manager, said. </p>

          <p>“Why is Smuggler a Superfund site, and over at the base of Aspen Mountain is not a Superfund site?” asked Cathy Hall, Pitkin County Solid Waste director, as other parts of the town of Aspen are built on tailing piles like the Smuggler trailer park. </p>

          <p>Each time soil is coming from Smuggler to the landfill, Hall gets a notification, she said, as the soil from the Superfund site cannot be mixed up with other soil, like topsoil. </p>

<p>The Smuggler soil is then used to cover trash in the landfill. At the end of the day, the landfill workers cover the trash with soil so rodents and bears can’t get it

       <p>“The soils can come here without any additional testing. It's all been tested extensively,” Hall said.</p>

       <p>Smuggler residents have to pay for the handling of their soil, but they negotiated the price tag 20 years ago. They pay $15 a ton, the rate for cover dirt, instead of $93.75 a ton, the for trash rate. </p>

<p>Hall said that last year they got 823 tons of Smuggler dirt, which is beneficial for the landfill since they need cover soil anyway soil to cover.

        <p>The landfill sees on average two or three excavation projects per year coming from Smuggler.</p>

        <p>“There's a pretty hefty sum of money that we collect on pennies per ton of trash that goes into that (Hazardous Substance Response) fund,” Hall said. The fund is used by the county to XXXX.</p>

        <p>Hall explained that the Smuggler soil is not leaching any lead into the groundwater or the environment. </p>

        <p>“The galena formation and the configuration of the metals combined with the host rock makes it inert, so we’re not getting any leaching,” Dunlop said. </p>


        <p>“The Superfund site has created a level of awareness,” Oliver from the City of Aspen said. “When we see potential development happening in other areas of town that have mining waste there, we're able to prescribe essentially the same level of health protection for those areas as we have with the Superfund site.” That protection includes soil testing, soil mitigation, dirt disposition.</p>

<br><h3>Clean Water</h3><br>

        <p>Unlike Silverton and Creede, the watershed in Aspen isn’t contaminated by its mining past, which also has helped to boost recreational activities in Aspen.</p>

<p>“The lead from the Superfund site seems very well bound in the soil and rock., Iit doesn't tend to leach out into the water,” Oliver said. </p>

          <p>“It’s totally clean,” said Chris Preusch, the former owner of the Smuggler Mine. “We’d go down about 86 feet-90 feet and we would hit the water level.”</p>

          <p>Preusch explained that most of the gold mines have higher acidity rates, with high levels of aluminum and iron. The Smuggler Mine and the Molly Gibson shaft were used for silver mining, and the lack of sun didn’t make the algae growth possible. </p>

          <p>“The dirtiest is when the mines are in operation because when you’re operating underground, and you’re pumping water, you’re pumping a lot of sand and silts with that coming the metals,” Preusch said. </p>

          <p>He said that the mine was pumping until 1918. They were discharging 7,200 gallons a minute out of the workings below Aspen, and this water went to the Roaring Fork River, which made the river unsuitable for fish. Aquatic life came back once the water started to get cleaner after pumping stopped. </p>

          <p>But the Smuggler Mine has a dual permit, both an excavation permit that allows them to extract 25 tons a day, and a tourism permit that lets them hold mine tours for tourists and local students. </p>

 <p>Preusch and a group of friends bought the mining property in 1994 before selling it in 2015. But Preusch and Jay Parker, one of the friends, still manage the property on the behalf of the new owner, Aspen Green Mountain.

          <p>Nowadays, the EPA comes once every five years to inspect the property. The mine needs to be compliant with three elements: making sure the entrance gate is closed, dust mitigation and water mitigation by making sure water stays on site.</p>

          <p>The inspection goes pretty quickly. Usually it only takes five minutes for the EPA inspector to come here, look around and leave. </p>

          <p>Preusch said that the county and he are struggling to pass down the baton to the next generation. Dunlop, who works for the county environmental health department, retired in 2001, but since no one else had his level of expertise, he is still in charge of the Superfund site for the county. Dunlop is now training the current environmental health director, so that one day he can finally fully retire. </p>

          <p>There’s also a quick turnaround at the EPA, so people who have been around for a long time, like Preusch, need to explain the story and the issues of the site every time someone new comes along. </p>

          <p>“Most people these days aren't willing to even get in 100 yards of an EPA document,” Preusch said. “Nobody's willing to read between the lines.”</p>

          <p>In 1994, when Preusch and a friend of his stepped up to take ownership of the property and take on the EPA, their attorney quit. “My attorney, who was one of my very best friend's father, pulled me aside and he said, ‘Chris if you do this I can no longer represent you,’” Preusch said.</p>

          <p>But Preusch said that he knew that the EPA didn’t have a case against them. After the site got delisted, Smuggler was buried as deep in the file cabinet as possible, he said. </p>

<p>With a permit that allows them to extract only 25 tons a day, the mine isn’t profitable anymore. Preusch hopes that one day the mine will be only a tour mine that keeps the memory and history of mining alive.

        <p>Looking around the mines, along the sides of the property, several multi-million houses are now built on the Superfund property.</p>

 <p>“We are surrounded by big wealth, and if the EPA wants to wander back in here, they're going to get mired down,” Preusch said. “All these people will get together, they'll combine their money, and they will tie them up for centuries.”
